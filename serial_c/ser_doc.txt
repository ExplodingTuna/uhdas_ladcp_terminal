Installation:

ser_asc and ser_bin should be owned by root and the suid
bit should be set; this allows them to lock memory and use
realtime scheduling.  They will use their suid root privilege
only for this purpose, and then drop it.

chmod u+s ser_asc ser_bin

They will write lock files in /var/lock, and they will not
take advantage of their suid privilege to do so.  Therefore,
/var/lock needs to be world-writable (or writable by whoever
is running ser_*), and the serial port also needs to be readable
and writable by the user.


Usage:

ser_asc [options] [string1] [string2] ...
ser_asc_zmq [options] [string1] [string2] ...

   string1 and string2 are the initial parts
   of each of up to 10 desired messages.  These initial
   string segments to be matched can be any length, but will
   typically be something like "$GPGGA".  The match always
   starts at the beginning of the string. If no messages are
   specified, use the "-a" switch to indicate all strings should
   be logged.



ser_bin [options]
ser_bin_zmq [options]

---------------------------------------------------------------

  Options common to ser_asc and ser_bin.
  --------------------------------------
   b :  Baud rate, e.g. 9600
   P :  Port name, e.g. ttyS1.  At present, this must
        not include the full path, and the path /dev/ is
        assumed.
   d :  Directory in which data will be logged.
   f :  Prefix of filename for data. (E.g., "km" for the
        Kilo Moana)
   e :  Extension of data file. (E.g., ".raw" for binary,
        ".gps" for nmea messages from a gps receiver.)
   y :  yearbase for file naming
   m :  /* 0: decimal day; 1: seconds; 2: hhmmss; 3: .jyd */
        File naming method.  UHDAS standard is 1.
   M :  Start a new file at integral multiple of this number
        of minutes.
   H :  Same, but hours. Include M or H, but not both.
        UHDAS standard is "-H 2".
   c :  Require valid checksum for RDI raw (NB, BB, or OS)
        or for NMEA, if ascii

   F :  Flush each block to disk immediately instead of buffering.
        This is essential in UHDAS because we are processing
        the data as it lands in files.
   T :  long integer argument, unix time: use this time for
        naming the first file. This is used to synchronize the
        filenames from the different data streams when starting
        UHDAS.

   i :  Input pipe name to optionally replace stdin. A single 'X'
        received via stdin, or this pipe if it is present, stops
        the process.
   o :  Output pipe name to optionally replace stdout.


  Options specific to ascii files.
  ---------------------------------
   s :  skip;  -s 5  means keep every 5th line.
   a :  Log all lines.  Overrides specific message list;
        required if no messages are specified.
   t :  Preceed each line with a time tag message.

    Note: in ser_asc_zmq, the skip value applies only to the
    lines written to disk, not to the zmq messages.  A value
    less than or equal to zero will suppress file writing.

  Options specific to ser_asc_zmq and ser_bin_zmq
  ------------------------------------------------
   Z :  The zmq url, e.g., "tcp://*:5556"

  Options specific to binary files.
  ---------------------------------
   O :  Include this if and only if logging OS, WH, or BB
        raw data.
   I :  Initiate pinging.  This gives the command
        to start pinging; the type of command depends
        on the instrument, which is OS, WH, or BB if the
        O option is given, otherwise NB.
   l :  Write a log file with each data file.
   E :  Log errors to a "*.err" file.

   B :  Minimum data block size in bytes.  Reject smaller
        chunks.  Should be needed only if logging via
        evesdropping on a serial line when the instrument
        is controlled by VMDAS, or other program that
        requests each ping.
   t :  Floating point number; pause in seconds between
        serial data streams for sequential pings.
        Default is 0.1 second.
   v :  cc_vmin  (integer) min number of characters
        default is 0
   V :  cc_vtime (integer, 1/10ths of second)
        inter-character timer (if vmin > 0) or
        timeout (if vmin = 0)
        default is 1

   r :  RDI raw (NB, BB, WH, or OS), not ancient DAS ensemble
        This option is obsolete and no longer needed.


Note: you should use one and only one of the -M and -H
options.  If you use either, the default is equivalent to
-H2, but it is better to be explicit.
